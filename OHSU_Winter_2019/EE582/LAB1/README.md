In this lab we analyze the sound

```python
def convolve(input1, input2):

    ''' Perfroms convolution operation on two input np.array
    objects. Sets the smaller of the two inputs to 'h_t' and
    the longer of the two to x_t. Returns an np.array that is
    the convolution sum of the two signals. '''
