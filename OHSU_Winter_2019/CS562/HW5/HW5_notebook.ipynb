This function uses a depth first search to look for places where it can collapse the tree. Since we are altering the object itself on the fly, there is really no need to return anything for this function other than for easy output. The accesses methods added to the class make working with the objects very easy in terms of getting elements and iterating through elements."

First, about my implementation: this is again a depth first recursive method that takes action on replacing nodes with more than two children as shallow as possible. The issue I was having was that when I would look at the labels of nodes that were parents of many levels of lower nodes, the label would contain all the information of the make up of the lower tree. Since this was not the desired label value I used regular expressions to parse out the important information from the label, but I realize that this is not an elegant solution and that there is some way I could alter my recursion to allow me to avoid this. The code is heavily commented and the process can be seen there."

    "To enable the the `from stream` method to be used witht he `from_string` style stack data structure while still allowing it to `yield` from a generator object, a few modifications had to be made to the `from string` code. The stack is initialized as usual, but now, right after the stack initialization, a `while(1)` loop is entered to allow for the continual reading from the file. Each iteration of this loop calls `stream.readline()`, giving us a single head, terminal node, or right delimiter. The string resulting from the readline then cascades down through the same stack location assignment as in the `from_string()`. This time however, where before there was a check if a right delimiter was missing and an exception raised if it was, this time we continue to read another line instead. This allows the file to be processed line by line. Once there is a matching closing delimiter, the stack is yeilded in the same way it was in `from_string()` and then the stack is cleared to prepare for a `next()` call.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method works well but a few concessions had to be made. First of all, the file has to be in the new line seperated fromat that our `.psd` file is in. Second, the call to `continue` in an iteration where a closing delimiter was not found, and its replacing of where there used to be an exception raised, puts us in some danger. This file runs the risk of being fed data files that were not properly formatted and behaving strangly without an exception being raised. What this would look like would be an input file that has a removed closing delimiter, resulting in the entire file after that mising delimiter being read in as a single tree."
