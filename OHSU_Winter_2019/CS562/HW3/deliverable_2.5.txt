The languages have different performances because some
combinations of characters are more common among different
languages than in others the Spanish and Italian languages
are similar and therefore it is statistically more difficult
to distinguish which one as which. Some languages are very
unique compared to others. The characters in German are only
in German. Therefore its very easy to distinguish German
just due to the characters.
