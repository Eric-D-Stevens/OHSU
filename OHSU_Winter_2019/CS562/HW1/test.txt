MAINLAND CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTER QIAN QICHEN WAS HIGHLY SKEPTICAL OF TOKYO 'S EXPLANATIONS OF THE CONTENT OF THE NEWLY PUBLISHED US-JAPAN GUIDELINES FOR DEFENSE COOPERATION WHEN HE MET MONDAY IN BEIJING WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF JAPAN 'S PRESS
QIAN ALSO SAID THE TIME IS NOT RIPE YET FOR A TRILATERAL OFFICIAL DIALOGUE AMONG WASHINGTON BEIJING AND TOKYO ON DEFENSE ADDING THAT `` SCHOLARLY DISCUSSION '' WOULD BE APPROPRIATE AT THE PRESENT
QIAN 'S REMARKS INDICATE THAT DESPITE EXPLANATIONS OF THE NEW GUIDELINES BY JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER RYUTARO HASHIMOTO AND FOREIGN MINISTER KEIZO OBUCHI BEIJING IS STILL VERY WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER TAIWAN FALLS WITHIN THE SPHERE OF THE BILATERAL DEFENSE AGREEMENT
ACCORDING TO REPORTS IN THE JAPANESE MEDIA AMONG QIAN 'S CONCERNS ARE -- IF THE DEFENSE PACT IS A MATTER BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND TOKYO IT SHOULD BE UNNECESSARY TO RENEW IT HENCE PUTTING ITS CONTENT INTO DOUBT
