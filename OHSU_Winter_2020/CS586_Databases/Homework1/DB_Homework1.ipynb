    "### 2a) \n",
    "**Question:** Can two languages have the same name?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Yes, since the primary key is `lang_id` the `language` attribute can have repeats (the cardinality of  `spy.language` is not that of the `spy.language.language`. Currently, however, there are no repeats in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2b) \n",
    "**Question:** How many languages can an agent speak?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Using the table `spy.languagerel` we can see that an agent can speak as many languages as cardinality of the `spy.language` table. Currently this number is 20 languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2c) \n",
    "**Question:** How many security clearance levels can an agent have?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** This is a bit of a tricky question. If we assume that each agent can only have a single `agent_id` then we can say that each agent can only have a single clearance. However, because `agent_id` is the primary key it is possible that the same person could be assigned multiple `agent_id`s and could therefore be assigned multible clearances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2d) \n",
    "**Question:** How many agents can have a given skill?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The `skillrel` primary key is the joint attributes `(skill_id, agent_id)`. There is no limit to the number of agents that a skill can be assigned to. The only limit to the number of agents that can have a given skill is the cardinality of the `agent` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2e) \n",
    "**Question:** How many teams can participate in any given mission?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** In the `mission` table, `mission_id` is the primary key and is associated with a `team_id`. Therefore, only a single team can be associated with any `mission_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2f)\n",
    "**Question:** Can two agents have different affiliation strengths to the same organization?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The question is unclear since the term *organization* does not appear in any of the relevant tables. `aff_id` is the primary key of the `affiliation` table while the combined `(aff_id, agent_id)` is the primary key of `affiliationrel`. Lets assume that *organization* has a one-to-one mapping with `aff_id`. In this case, it is still possible for two different agents to have two different affiliation strengths to the same organization, since in the `affiliationrel` table, there is no constraint on the `affiliation_strength` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2g) \n",
    "**Question:** Can one agent have different affiliation_strengths to two or more different organizations?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** This case is the same as the previous. Organization is not clearly defined. Again assuming a one-to-one mapping from *organization* to `aff_id`, it is possible for one agent to have different affiliation strength in different organizations, since the primary key of the `affiliationrel` table would differ in the `aff_id` attribute. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2h) \n",
    "**Question:** Can an agent participate in more than one ongoing mission?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Yes, missions are assigned to teams and agents are assigned to teams through the `teamrl` table. The primary key for the `teamrel` table is the joint `(team_id, agent_id)` attribute. Therefore, an agent can be assigned to multiple teams without violating the primary key of `teamrel`. There appears to be no constraint on `mission.mission_status` and therefore no reason an agent on two or more teams could not be assigned to multiple active missions. \n",
