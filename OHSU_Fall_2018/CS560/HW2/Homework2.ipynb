A ground instance of a clause is obtained by uniformly subsituting constants appearing in the knowledge base or in any query for the variables in teh clauses.\" (CI. p.54) In this case the variable $a$ doesnt appear in any clause or query in the knowledge base, but we have been explicitly told that $a$ is a constant in our syntax. Therefore, the proof prcedure is valid.\n",

With the introduction of the atom q(Y,Y), which our poor substitution forced, we immediately know that we will not be able to resolve this query. We come to this realization through an inspection of the knowledge base. In KB we can see that there is no fact that allows the s predicate to contain two of the of the same constants. We also see that there is no clause with the s predicate in the head, so there is no way to add further s ground instances.\n",
