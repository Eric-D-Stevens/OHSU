    "My initial thought was to add a `n(0)` predicate but then we would have the problem of being able to have expressions like `s(0) == s(n(s(0)))`, resulting in the same number being represented in two different ways. Therefore, it seems that they best way to extend the scheme is to add another constant. We will add the constant `-0`, which will represent a negative zero. The `s(X)` in increment the numerical value of `X` in the direction of the sign of `X`. Examples of the way this would work follows: \n",

    "**This code does not work.** Below are two different attempts that I made to solve this problem. The first tries to call a function recursivly and hold the frontier in the recursion. The second tries to maintain the frontier in a list in the the for loop of the program. I have not had success. These functions are both capable of solving the first query as the output demonstrates, but are unable to solve the second query. Something is wrong with the way they move from child back up to parent nodes. They either get stuck in an infinite loop or terminate without completing the proof. I ran out of time to solve the problem."

    "My second attempt seems to be closer to what was intended so I will discuss that attempt. The idea was to append the frontier with any match that is found in the process of colecting matches. After each matching round, the final match is popped of the list and unified. In other words, I am treating frontier as a stack in which matches are pushed onto and poped off of. The idea was that treating the matches as a stack and poping the top of the stack to resolve would result in a depth first search. For some reason I could not get it to resolve clauses that faild on some braches.  The case above results in an infinite loop with a building frontier. Other options I tried resulted in termination at the bottom of a failed branch. \n",
